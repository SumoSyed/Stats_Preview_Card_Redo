## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Mobile-first workflow

**Note: These are just examples. Delete this note and replace the list above with your own choices**

### What I learned

Learned the basics of media query and practiced what I learned on HTML/CSS. Followed a mobile-first approach since first try was a desktop first. Yet to complete desktop design but will use flex. 

### Continued development

Would like to further learn media query, designing for mobile first and then desktop as well as focus on learning flexbox more. Further down would like to incorporate JS into my projects as well.

### Useful resources

- [Gap below image](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5804256/image-inside-div-has-extra-space-below-the-image) - This helped me with a gap in image at the bottom of the image despite not having any padding or margin added. Will be making a note to self to make images to be displayed as block vs inline, depending on circumstances.
